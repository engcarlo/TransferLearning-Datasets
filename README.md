## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To get started with `TransferLearning-Datasets`, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and `pip` installed on your system. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/engcarlo/TransferLearning-Datasets.git
cd TransferLearning-Datasets
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory and install the necessary Python packages. While no `requirements.txt` is provided, common libraries for machine learning and Jupyter Notebooks are usually needed.

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow # Or pytorch, depending on the notebook content
```


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook and explore the transfer learning examples.

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To open the main transfer learning notebook, run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook M2_transfer_learning.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute cells and interact with the code and datasets.

### Exploring the Notebook

The `M2_transfer_learning.ipynb` notebook typically demonstrates:

*   Loading and preprocessing datasets from the `Dataset/` directory.
*   Applying pre-trained models (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch torchvision).
*   Fine-tuning models for specific tasks.
*   Evaluating model performance.

```python
# Example of a cell within M2_transfer_learning.ipynb
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load a sample dataset (placeholder)
# df = pd.read_csv('Dataset/sample_data.csv') 
# print(df.head())

# Example of loading a pre-trained model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add custom layers for transfer learning
x = Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # Assuming 10 classes

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Freeze base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
print("Model compiled for transfer learning.")
```

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to `TransferLearning-Datasets`! To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

*   **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `TransferLearning-Datasets` repository to your GitHub account.
*   **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use descriptive names like `feature/add-new-dataset` or `bugfix/fix-notebook-error`.
*   **Code Style:** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code. For Jupyter Notebooks, ensure code cells are clean, well-commented, and outputs are cleared before committing.
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    *   Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    *   Provide a detailed description of your changes and why they are necessary.
    *   Ensure all existing code runs without errors.
    *   If adding new features or datasets, include relevant documentation or examples.
*   **Testing:** Before submitting a PR, ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Run all cells in modified notebooks to confirm they execute correctly.
